Many rightly ask: what is the metaverse, why does it matter, and how can Meta and other tech companies be trusted to build these technologies responsibly? Here's my attempt to address some of these questions.

This is a long piece, but the aim is to share our view on why the metaverse is a compelling new evolution of the internet; highlight some of the potential benefits it creates for education, healthcare and economic opportunity; and explain why it needs to be open and interoperable.

The metaverse is not a single product or an operating system. It isn’t a single piece of cloth, but a patchwork quilt. There won’t be a Meta-run metaverse, just as there isn’t a ‘Microsoft internet’ or ‘Google internet’ today.

The metaverse is at a critical early stage in its development. There is nothing deterministic in the way a technology impacts society. That is why we must create thoughtful rules and put guardrails into place as the metaverse develops to maximize its potential for good and minimize the potential harms.

By working together from this early stage – across industry, the public sector, academia and civil society – we can learn from the past, and begin to answer these questions and develop these norms and standards as this next phase of the internet is built.

　　“各地围绕潮生活、夜经济和新品牌等主题，组织了各具特色的配套活动。电商平台积极联动优秀品牌企业，推出新品首发预售、限时抢购和特价秒杀等多种促销方式，让消费者买得实惠、买得称心。”束珏婷说。(记者王雨萧、胡锐)

据日媒sponichi annex报道，冬奥会开幕式次日，日本著名导演、演员和节目主持人北野武在TBS电视台“新·情报7DAYS”节目中对北京冬奥会大胆创新，点燃火炬的方式羡慕不已。

日媒在报道中专门提及，本次冬奥会的总导演张艺谋也是2008年北京奥运会的总导演。那一年，李宁手持火炬在“鸟巢”上方腾空奔跑点燃主火炬的一幕成为奥运会开幕式经典瞬间。而本次并未如以往一样依惯例在圣火台点火，而是采取了在舞台中央的雪花装置中心放置火炬这样一种新形式，让世人惊讶。

北野武在采访中提及，就因为自己曾说了几句东京奥运会开幕式不好，结果被很多网民追着骂。对于本次北京冬奥会点火，他直言，日本就只记住“必须在圣火台上点火”。因为日本没有策划能力，所以才会只有“必须在圣火台上点火”这一个想法。很让人后悔。

24节气倒计时、黄河之水天上来、“破冰”而出的冰雪五环……2月4日，北京冬奥会开幕式上一幕幕诗意与创意结合的场景令全世界瞩目。

作为最受关注的主火炬点燃环节，今年的北京冬奥会也别出心裁、大胆创新，在浪漫唯美的雪花火炬台中央，把最后一棒火炬直接放在主火炬台上，不点火，这是百年奥运史上前所未有的场景。

据新华社报道，张艺谋曾介绍，“将熊熊燃烧的奥运之火，幻化成雪花般圣洁、灵动的小火苗，这一创意来自低碳环保理念。”奥运火种是奥林匹克精神的重要象征，随着环保理念愈发深入人心，他坚信以往熊熊大火的形态总有一天要改变，而北京冬奥会恰好抓住机遇。“这种改变是颠覆性的，有时我甚至问自己是不是离经叛道了。最终，这一方案获得国际奥委会支持，说明无论火焰大小，只要点燃大家的心中之火，就是最璀璨的圣火！”

这一设计也有诗意的体现。通过一个小小的火苗，想到的是奥林匹克精神，这是中国传统“一叶知秋”的美学观念，“中国古老的哲学，中国人的美学观念从来就是这样，一叶知秋，一滴水看太阳，从来就是以点代面，中国人讲的是意境，讲的是从一个最小、最细节的角度来看整个世界，我觉得是很美的。一个小小的手持火炬，一个小小的火苗，但是你想到的是伟大的奥林匹克精神，是全人类的一个熊熊燃烧的激情和浪漫。”
measurements from this run are different from the measured performance of the last run. The significance level is the desired probability that two measurements of identical code will be considered ‘different’ due to noise in the measurements. The default value is 0.05, meaning that approximately 5%
👎 Deprecated since 0.3.4: No longer useful; since the plotters backend is available Criterion.rs can always generate plots
Names an explicit baseline and enables overwriting the previous results.
This presents a trade-off. By setting the significance level closer to 0.0, you can increase the statistical robustness against noise, but it also weakens Criterion.rs’ ability to detect small but real changes in the performance. By setting the significance level closer to 1.0, Criterion.rs will be more able to detect small true changes, but will also report more spurious differences.
Document all targets in benchmark mode that have the bench = true manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the bench flag in the manifest settings for the target.
Document all targets in test mode that have the test = true manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries

Fact: A fact is data about our members or videos. An example of data about members is the video they had watched or added to their My List. An example of video data is video metadata, like the length of a video. Time is a critical component of Axion — When we talk about facts, we talk about facts at a moment in time. These facts are managed and made available by services like viewing history or video metadata services outside of Axion.

With all the volatility and business-model reinvention today, data teams do not have months or years to deliver business value. At the same time, they often face resource constraints like a lack of in-house experts in Python or Scala.

For example, say we have a five-node cluster with nodes {A, B, C, D, E}, where {A, B, C} are replicas for the executed write operation, and node B is down. A, being the coordinator for the query, picks node D to satisfy the sloppy quorum and maintain the desired availability and durability guarantees. Now, data is replicated to {A, D, C}. However, the record at D will have a hint in its metadata, since the write was originally intended for B. As soon as B recovers, D will attempt to forward a hint back to it. Once the hint is replayed on B, it can be safely removed without reducing the total number of replicas [DECANDIA07].
