measurements from this run are different from the measured performance of the last run. The significance level is the desired probability that two measurements of identical code will be considered ‘different’ due to noise in the measurements. The default value is 0.05, meaning that approximately 5%
👎 Deprecated since 0.3.4: No longer useful; since the plotters backend is available Criterion.rs can always generate plots
Names an explicit baseline and enables overwriting the previous results.
This presents a trade-off. By setting the significance level closer to 0.0, you can increase the statistical robustness against noise, but it also weakens Criterion.rs’ ability to detect small but real changes in the performance. By setting the significance level closer to 1.0, Criterion.rs will be more able to detect small true changes, but will also report more spurious differences.
Document all targets in benchmark mode that have the bench = true manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the bench flag in the manifest settings for the target.
Document all targets in test mode that have the test = true manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries
json-render-diagnostics: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc diagnostics in in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo's own JSON diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still emitted. Cannot be used with human or short
ither of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is up-to-date. If the lock file is missing
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the build.jobs config value. Defaults to the number of CPUs.
The specified target for the current package (or package specified by -p if provided) will be documented with the specified args being passed to the final rustdoc invocation. Dependencies will not be documented as part of this command. Note that rustdoc will still unconditionally receive arguments such as
This command requires that only one target is being compiled when additional arguments are provided. If more than one target is available for the current package the filters of --lib, --bin, etc, must be used to select which target is compiled.
侮辱罪の法定刑を引き上げる刑法改正案が18日、衆院法務委員会で可決された。採決に先立ち、表現の自由を制約していないかを3年後に検証することなどを付則に明記する修正が行われた
Fact: A fact is data about our members or videos. An example of data about members is the video they had watched or added to their My List. An example of video data is video metadata, like the length of a video. Time is a critical component of Axion — When we talk about facts, we talk about facts at a moment in time. These facts are managed and made available by services like viewing history or video metadata services outside of Axion.

Обычно в Китае говорят “nǐ hǎo” или 你好, чтобы поздороваться с собеседником. Помните, что в Китае много разных диалектов. Мы расскажем вам все, что нужно знать о китайских приветствиях.
With all the volatility and business-model reinvention today, data teams do not have months or years to deliver business value. At the same time, they often face resource constraints like a lack of in-house experts in Python or Scala.
你好 – перевод с китайского на русский
For example, say we have a five-node cluster with nodes {A, B, C, D, E}, where {A, B, C} are replicas for the executed write operation, and node B is down. A, being the coordinator for the query, picks node D to satisfy the sloppy quorum and maintain the desired availability and durability guarantees. Now, data is replicated to {A, D, C}. However, the record at D will have a hint in its metadata, since the write was originally intended for B. As soon as B recovers, D will attempt to forward a hint back to it. Once the hint is replayed on B, it can be safely removed without reducing the total number of replicas [DECANDIA07].
شجبت الحكومتان الليبية والفرنسية التفجير الذي استهدف سفارة فرنسا في طرابلس صباح الثلاثاء ما أدى لإصابة عدد من الأشخاص بجروح، كما أعلن وزير الداخلية الليبي عاشور شوايل أن الحكومة شكلت لجنة للتحقيق بمشاركة فرنسية وأنها مستعدة للتعاون مع مختلف الأطراف لمعرفة المسؤولين عن الهجوم، مؤكدا رفض بلاده تواجد أي قوات فرنسية في ليبيا لحماية سفارتها.
